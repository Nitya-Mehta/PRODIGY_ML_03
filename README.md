# Image Classification of Cats and Dogs Using Support Vector Machine (SVM)
This task focuses on building a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** model to classify images of cats and dogs as part of my Machine Learning internship at Prodigy InfoTech. The goal is to use a large dataset of labeled images to train the model to accurately distinguish between the two categories (cats and dogs), and evaluate its performance on a test dataset.

## 📁 Files in this Repository
`Task-3.ipynb:` Jupyter Notebook implementing the SVM model for image classification.<br>
`submission.csv:` CSV file containing the output predictions (class labels for the test set images).<br>

## 📊 Dataset Overview
The **Dogs vs Cats** dataset contains a total of `37,500` images:<br>

**Training Set:** `25,000` labeled images of cats and dogs.<br>
**Test Set:** `12,500` unlabeled images for evaluation.<br>
The goal is to train a model to classify these images into two categories: cat (0) or dog (1).<br>

The output predictions will be saved in `submission.csv`.

## 📈 Results
The SVM model was able to successfully classify the test images of cats and dogs, and the final predictions are stored in the submission.csv file for evaluation.
